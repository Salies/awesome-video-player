# awesome-video-player
An automatic, beautiful and pretty responsive YouTube player

**NOTICE:** This app requires the (unfortunately dead) VibrantJS API. Get it here [here](https://github.com/jariz/vibrant.js/releases/download/1.0/Vibrant.min.js) and add it to the app's folder.

**To be done:**
* Better selection of colors (maybe with a secondary color API)

* Code generator (for embedding in other websites)

* Color picker (in case of the user not liking the auto-selected colors)
